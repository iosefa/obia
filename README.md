Object Based Image Analysis


# note
look at: 
1. the spectral signatures of each species (300 of each) --> each band
2. the time series signature (from planet) of each species 
3. create or use a jupyter notebook environment on Jetstream (?)
4. modify code to use Koa HPC
   5. run models on HPC and then make data available for Jetstream
6. combining WV-imagery with sentinel dense ts for sub-pxiel analysis of forest cover change in hawaii.
   7. create a species classification map using WV-imagery.
   8. assign to sentinel pixel centroids and sub-pixel analysis
