# Project Status

`obia` is currently in repository cleanup and consolidation.

What is stable enough to use:

- core module layout under `obia/`
- segmentation, detection, classification, and utility code paths

What is still in progress:

- expanded tests and end-to-end examples
- fuller API docs and polished tutorials
- standardization of legacy interfaces and naming

If you find inconsistencies, open an issue in the repo and include the module path and traceback.
